# deployment note: please save this file /etc/tcp_ratio.yaml
# format note: only lower boundaries are must, for example
# 0: 1.0000
# 300: 0.9999
# 500: 0.9998
# means:
#       0~300(300 is not included) will use 1.0000 as ratio
#     300~500(500 is not included) will use 0.9999 as ratio
#     500~                         will use 0.9998 as ratio

# *** so you have always put a "0: xxx" item so that this range won't be missed
# *** any blank line or line starts with sharp will be ignored
# *** never start a valid line with space
# *** always use Linux file format (NO Windows)
